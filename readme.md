# Hamoye Data Science Internship
The following projects were carried during the phase of this 5months internship

1.Python for machine learning
+ Getting familiar with various python tools used for numerical analysis, data cleaning, data wrangling and data visualization to ensure Quality data in Machine learning.
2. Built a machine learning model to predict the Energy Efficiency of Buildings using Regression techniques in Machine learning.
+ Model evaluation using various evaluation metrics in regression such as the  Mean_absolute_error, Mean_squared_error, Residual_sum_of_squares, Root_mean_squared_error, r2_score 
3. Built a predictive model using ensemble learning and classification techniques to predict stability of Grid system
+ Model evaluation using various evaluation metrics in classification techniques such as the evaluation_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report(f1_score, recall, precision)
4. Built an Artificial intelligence algorithm to label satellite image chips with different atmospheric conditions and the different classes of land cover

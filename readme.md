# Hamoye Data Science Internship
The following projects were carried during the phase of this 5months internship

1. Predicting Energy Efficiency of Buildings using Regression techniques in Machine learning.
> Model evaluation using various evaluation metrics in regression such as the  Mean_absolute_error, Mean_squared_error, Residual_sum_of_squares, Root_mean_squared_error, r2_score 
3. Building a predictive model using ensemble learning and classification techniques to predict stability of Grid system
> Model evaluation using various evaluation metrics in classification techniques such as the evaluation_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report(f1_score, recall, precision)
4. Building an Artificial intelligence algorithm to label satellite image chips with different atmospheric conditions and the different classes of land cover
5.
